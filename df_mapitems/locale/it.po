"Cave moss is technically a form of mold, but fortunately a relatively benign "
"one given its ubiquity. Its fibers form a tough but springy mat over the "
"surface of any organic-rich soil that accumulates deep underground."

"Floor fungus produces a thin, slick film that spreads through the cracks of "
"broken rock. Its ability to subsist on the tiniest traces of nutrients means "

msgstr ""

#: df_mapitems\doc.lua:14

"Floor fungus has no known uses. It can penetrate deeply into cobblestone "
"constructions if an infestation gets hold, but it is difficult to transport "

"Glistening strings of silk hang from the ceilings of some of the larger "
"caverns, lit by the millions of tiny bioluminescent worms that spun them. "
"Glow worms prey on the insects they lure and entangle with their faux starry "
"sky - and sometimes the occasional bat or other larger flying beast."
msgstr ""

#: df_mapitems\doc.lua:17
msgid ""
"Glow worms can be harvested and used as a source of light but they die when "
"exposed to light significantly brighter than themselves or when immersed in "
"water. A colony of glow worms hung in a hospitable environment will undergo "
"a modest amount of growth, allowing it to be divided and propagated."

"The iconic stalactites and stalagmites found in caverns are composed of "

"Monolithic crystals of this size form only over extremely long periods deep "
