"Aside from the artistic applications of its particularly dark color, black "
"cap wood is a long-burning fuel source that's as good as coal for some "

msgid ""
"Blood thorns are the most vicious of underground flora, as befits their "
"harsh environments. Found only in hot, dry caverns with sandy soil far from "
"the surface world's organic bounty, blood thorns seek to supplement their "
"nutrient supply with wickedly barbed hollow spines that actively drain "
"fluids from whatever stray plant or creature they might impale."

msgid ""
"When harvested, the central stalk of a blood thorn can be cut into planks "
"and used as wood. It has a purple-red hue that may or may not appeal, "
"depending on one's artistic tastes."
msgstr ""

#: df_trees\doc.lua:17
msgid ""
"The spikes of a blood thorn can actually remain living long after they're "
"severed from their parent stalk, a testament to their tenacity. As long as "
"they remain alive they will continue to actively drain anything they "
"puncture, though they don't grow."
msgstr ""

#: df_trees\doc.lua:18
msgid ""
"Living blood thorn spikes remain harmful to creatures that touch them. If "
"killed by bright light, they cause only passive damage to creatures that "

"Fungiwood stalk is strong and very fine-grained, making smooth yellow-tinted "

"Nether caps have an unusual biochemistry that allows them to somehow subsist "
"on ambient heat, in violation of all known laws of thermodynamics. They grow "

msgstr ""

#: df_trees\doc.lua:27

"Nether cap wood, in addition to being a beautiful blue hue, retains the odd "

msgid ""
"Spore trees have a sturdy 'trunk' that supports a large spongy mesh of "

msgid ""
"The trunk of a tunnel tube can be cut and processed to produce plywood-like "

"Torchspines are strange organic formations that are alive only in a "

"A torchspine alternates between active and quiescent phases and emits dim "
