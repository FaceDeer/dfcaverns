These towering structures, which I have named Fungiwood, stood at least twenty to thirty feet tall, with a central stalk that was incredibly strong and fine-grained. The spore-producing 'shelves' that surrounded the stalk were thin and irregular, but not particularly useful for either building or as a food source.
	
However, the central stalk proved to be an invaluable discovery. When cut, it produces smooth yellow-tinted lumber that is perfect for crafting. It is no wonder that so many carved wooden objects from the deeps are made from this Fungiwood. I have collected samples of the lumber and will study it further to see if it has any other unique properties. This discovery opens up a whole new realm of possibilities for subterranean exploration and commerce.]]),

Their spines are barbed, sharp, and hollow, capable of actively draining fluids from any plant or creature they might impale. I can only assume this is to supplement the poor nutrition and hydration otherwise available to them.

When harvested the central stalk of a blood thorn can be cut into planks and used as wood. It has a purple-red hue that may or may not appeal, depending on one's artistic tastes.

Despite their fearsome reputation, I must admit, I was struck by the tenacity of these plants. The spikes can remain living even after they're severed from the parent stalk, continuing to drain anything they come into contact with. Even if killed by bright light they can still cause damage to creatures that fall on them.

These mushrooms are truly impressive, towering above us like trees in a forest. Their stems are thick and dense, and the caps are a deep, rich black. We were particularly interested in the wood of these mushrooms, which is a dense, heavy wood that is difficult to work with but makes for an excellent fuel source. The gills of the mushrooms are oily and make for an excellent torch fuel, burning with a bright and steady flame.

We were also told that the black color of the caps makes it a highly sought after material for artistic applications.

It's not hard to imagine that some of the more primitive denizens of the deeps might carve out a hollow in the stem of one of these mushrooms to use as a home.

The stems and caps of the Goblin Cap mushrooms are made of a wood that is both dense and strong. It can be cut into two different hues, a subdued cream and a bright orange-red. The cream colored wood is particularly hard and heavy, while the orange-red wood is lighter and more porous.

Their stems and caps provide ample quantities of woody material when cut down and processed. We were able to gather large amounts of this material and it holds great promise for use in construction and as a source of fuel for our expeditions.

The Nether Cap mushroom is a true marvel of nature. The wood of the mushroom, in addition to being a beautiful blue hue, retains the odd heat-draining ability of living Nether Caps and is able to quickly freeze nearby water solid. This makes it an incredibly unique and valuable resource, as it could have a wide range of industrial and scientific applications.

Furthermore, the Nether Cap mushroom is also a valuable tool for understanding the underground ecosystem.

This is beyond comprehension, as it defies the laws of thermodynamics. It is simply not possible for a biological organism to feed directly on heat. But yet, here they are. The caverns that they are found in are frigid and icy, which only adds to the confusion.

To make matters worse, the wood of the Nether cap somehow retains this heat-sapping ability even after it's cut. I have never seen anything like it before, and I must admit that I am at a loss for an explanation.

At times like this, it can be difficult to be a man of science. I would love to exterminate this species and put an end to this absurdity, but of course, that is not the way of science. We must study, we must observe, and we must learn. I will have to gather more data and try to make sense of what I am seeing.

Despite my frustration, I must admit that these mushrooms are a remarkable discovery. They have the potential to completely change our understanding of geothermal heat flows. I just need to stay objective and stick to the facts.

It is frustrating, but the life of a scientist is not always easy. We must be willing to accept that sometimes, our predictions are wrong and that there are things that we simply cannot explain.

These subterranean fungi are characterized by their short, sturdy trunks that support a large spongy mesh of branching fibers with embedded fruiting bodies. These fruiting bodies produce a copious amount of spores that gently rain down around the Spore Tree's base.

The trunks of Spore Trees can be cut into pale woody planks, which are useful for a variety of purposes. The branching fibers and fruiting bodies, on the other hand, are only useful as fuel. However, they can also serve as a crude climbing structure, which can be very useful in caverns with many pits and cliffs to navigate. In fact, the spongy fibers have been known to cushion a climber's fall, saving the lives of a few incautious but lucky spelunkers.

It's important to note that while these fungi may be useful, they can also be dangerous. The spores produced by the fruiting bodies can cause respiratory issues if inhaled in large quantities, so it's important to take proper precautions when exploring caverns with Spore Trees. Overall, the Spore Trees are an intriguing and valuable species of subterranean fungi that can offer many benefits to those who are willing to take the time to study and understand them.]]),

They can be used as a wood substitute in many crafting recipes.

The most distinctive feature of Spindlestem mushrooms is their glow, with some varieties having caps that glow in a red, green, cyan, or even sometimes golden hue. This glow is generated by some form of microorganism that lives within the Spindlestem's caps and can be extracted and bottled to produce a long-lasting source of light.

The brightness of this light varies with the colour of the cap, but even the dim red Spindlestem extract makes a useful trail marker in these dark caverns.

To test this hypothesis, I ventured further into the cavern and found another group of Spindlestems, this time emitting a green glow. I hypothesized that this might be an indication of nearby copper deposits. I conducted a series of experiments to confirm my suspicions, and to my delight, my hypothesis was correct.

I also found that some Spindlestems were emitting a cyan glow, which I suspect is an indication of a mix of both iron and copper deposits. I found this discovery to be quite exciting, and I believe it could have significant implications for underground mining operations.

First, I would like to point out that when growing near Goblin Caps, Spindlestems always glow red regardless of the minerals in the soil. This is a fascinating observation that I believe warrants further study. Second, when growing near Tower Caps, Spindlestems don't glow at all. This is another intriguing observation that I believe is worth investigating.

I would like to remind my colleagues that not everything can be reduced to chemistry, and that there is still much we do not understand about the complex interactions between different subterranean organisms. Furthermore, Banks has no explanation for the rare yellow Spindlestem, which is a beautiful and unique variant of this mushroom species.
