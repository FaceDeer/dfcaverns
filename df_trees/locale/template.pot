"The dense black wood of these mushrooms is heavy and hard to work with, and "

msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:13
msgid ""
"Aside from the artistic applications of its particularly dark color, black "
"cap wood is a long-burning fuel source that's as good as coal for some "
"applications. Black cap gills are oily and make for excellent torch fuel."

#: doc.lua:15
msgid ""
"Blood thorns are the most vicious of underground flora, as befits their "
"harsh environments. Found only in hot, dry caverns with sandy soil far from "
"the surface world's organic bounty, blood thorns seek to supplement their "
"nutrient supply with wickedly barbed hollow spines that actively drain "
"fluids from whatever stray plant or creature they might impale."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:16
msgid ""
"When harvested, the central stalk of a blood thorn can be cut into planks "
"and used as wood. It has a purple-red hue that may or may not appeal, "
"depending on one's artistic tastes."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:17
msgid ""
"The spikes of a blood thorn can actually remain living long after they're "
"severed from their parent stalk, a testament to their tenacity. As long as "
"they remain alive they will continue to actively drain anything they "
"puncture, though they don't grow."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:18
msgid ""
"Living blood thorn spikes remain harmful to creatures that touch them. If "
"killed by bright light, they cause only passive damage to creatures that "
"fall on them (as one would expect from an enormous spike)."

"Thin, irregular layers of spore-producing 'shelves' surround the strong "

msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:21
msgid ""
"Fungiwood stalk is strong and very fine-grained, making smooth yellow-tinted "
"lumber when cut. Fungiwood shelf is too fragile to be much use as anything "

"Nether caps have an unusual biochemistry that allows them to somehow subsist "
"on ambient heat, in violation of all known laws of thermodynamics. They grow "
"deep underground in frigid, icy caverns that should by all rights be "
"volcanic."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:27

"Nether cap wood, in addition to being a beautiful blue hue, retains the odd "
"heat-draining ability of living nether caps and is able to quickly freeze "

"Spore trees have a sturdy 'trunk' that supports a large spongy mesh of "

"amount of spores that gently rain down around the spore tree's base."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Spore tree trunks can be cut into pale woody planks. The branching fibers "

"Tunnel tubes are hollow, curved fungal growths that support a fruiting body."

#: doc.lua:37
msgid ""
"The trunk of a tunnel tube can be cut and processed to produce plywood-like "
"material. The fruiting body accumulates high-energy compounds that, when "
"ignited, produce a vigorous detonation - a unique adaptation for spreading "
"tunnel tube spawn through the still cavern air."
