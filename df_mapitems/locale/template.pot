"Cave moss is technically a form of mold, but fortunately a relatively benign "
"one given its ubiquity. Its fibers form a tough but springy mat over the "
"surface of any organic-rich soil that accumulates deep underground."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:12
msgid ""
"Cave moss has no known uses aside from the faint glow it emits. It dies when "
"exposed to bright light sources such as the Sun."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:13
msgid ""
"Floor fungus produces a thin, slick film that spreads through the cracks of "
"broken rock. Its ability to subsist on the tiniest traces of nutrients means "
"it's found in relatively harsh underground environments."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:14
msgid ""
"Floor fungus has no known uses. It can penetrate deeply into cobblestone "
"constructions if an infestation gets hold, but it is difficult to transport "
"and is inhibited by light so it hasn't spread beyond the deep caverns."

"Glistening strings of silk hang from the ceilings of some of the larger "
"caverns, lit by the millions of tiny bioluminescent worms that spun them. "
"Glow worms prey on the insects they lure and entangle with their faux starry "
"sky - and sometimes the occasional bat or other larger flying beast."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:17
msgid ""
"Glow worms can be harvested and used as a source of light but they die when "
"exposed to light significantly brighter than themselves or when immersed in "
"water. A colony of glow worms hung in a hospitable environment will undergo "
"a modest amount of growth, allowing it to be divided and propagated."

"A nasty kelp-like plant that grows in patches on the floor of the Sunless "
"Sea. Its reflective patches draw in the unwary and then its prickly barbs "
"catch and hold small creatures."

"Flowstone is a carbonate-rich rock formation deposited by flowing water. It "
"consists of minerals that the water dissolved earlier as it widens cracks "
"and fissures into caves."

"Aside from the aesthetic beauty of its formations flowstone has no special "
"properties or uses."
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:27
msgid ""
"The iconic stalactites and stalagmites found in caverns are composed of "
"flowstone (or 'dripstone' in the case of these formations). Moist dripstone "
"is still undergoing growth, whereas dry dripstone is found in 'dead' caverns "
"once the source of water that created them ceases."
msgstr ""

"Although stalagmites are blunter than the stalactites above them, they can "
"cause extra damage to the unwary caver who falls on them."

"Deep in the infernal conditions of the magma sea, over the course of "
"millions of years, mese crystals grow into flawless blocks that glow bright "

"These blocks can be broken down into a large number of mese crystals, but "

"Large, dry caverns deep underground are well suited to aeons-long processes "
"that concentrate crystalline substances in their walls. This rock is riddled "

"Monolithic crystals of this size form only over extremely long periods deep "
"underground, in large long-lived cavities that allow them room to grow. "
"Water and the life it hosts tend to disrupt the formation process of these "
"crystals so they're only found in dry environments."
